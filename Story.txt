My name is Declan. I go to Madison and study computer science. The weather is lovely and warm this time of year! I hope it will snow sometime soon.

Just kidding, I wish springtime would come as soon as possible. I love the
sound of all the snow melting and pouring down the drain, and of all 
the birds chirping. Spring is definitely the best season of the year.
