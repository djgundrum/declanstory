My name is Declan. I go to Madison and study computer science. The weather is lovely and warm this time of year! I hope it will snow sometime soon.

Just kidding, I wish springtime would come as soon as possible. I love the
sound of all the snow melting and pouring down the drain, and of all 
the birds chirping. Spring is definitely the best season of the year.

Just kidding, I wish fall would come as soon as possible. I love the sound 
of all the leaves crunching, all their changing colors, and all the rain
 pouring down. Fall is definitely the best season of the year. 

And I finished all my other tasks. I am just thinking about going to eat something.
With my teammates we decided to go home.

This was just made so that I could show someone else how this is done

And that's a wrap for xteam 30, we grew together as group. We formed, then we 
stormed, normed, and performed as a group. Couldn't be more proud of us.
